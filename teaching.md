	<li>Created an 8-week summer course on discrete mathematics to close the theory gap (many students have insufficient mathematical background for the Harvard CS theory core--this is also an accessiblity for CS as a discipline at Harvard). Over 100 Harvard Students enrolled.</li>
	<li>Created the curriculum of videos, readings, and problem sets. </li>
	<li>Recruited and manage a 15-person teaching staff.</li>

### Other Experiences

I believe that teaching a diversity of subjects in diverse environments really improves ones teaching ability. Below is a short list of some of the other (especially non-technical) places I've been lucky to teach and help develop curriculum at!

 - [Stanford D School](https://dschool.stanford.edu/)
 - [Design Thinking Institute](https://www.nuevaschool.org/conferences-institutes/design-thinking)
 - [Bay Area Urban Debate League](https://www.baudl.org/)
 - [Victory Briefs Institute](https://www.vbidebate.com/)
 - [Nueva Summer](https://www.nuevaschool.org/enrichment/nueva-summer)
