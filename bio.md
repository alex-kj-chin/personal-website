I'm a technologist who's interested in improving education and accessibility. I've always found teaching rewarding, and as I've acquired more technical skills, I've seen (both in general and through my own projects) how technology can greatly augment the eduational experience. I'm passionated about using technology to improve education, both through data-driven decisions and classroom products that help teachers and individualize curricula to students. I've pursued these interests working with school districts to help them actualize data-driven systems, using technology to improve courses as a teaching fellow at Harvard, and through additional research projects.
