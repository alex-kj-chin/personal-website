I'm primarily interested in two applications of technology to education. I've pursued projects in both of these spaces.

 1. How can schools use data to improve their decision-making process? I've worked with various research organizations to do help school districts evaluate which programs are working and draw actionable insight from their data.
 2. How can learning assist pedagogy? I've worked on a tool for the Harvard CS Department and am currently building a personalized learning platform to increase accessibility to standardized test preparation resources.

However, through conversations with existing Patel Fellows, I found that many Patel Fellows were unsure how to identify struggling students, and an open invitation for assistance was usually taken by students already doing fine in the course (in other words, struggling students often do not know how to advocate for themselves). I built a simple tool to identify struggling students using previous assignement scores and ran a team in CS 181 providing support to struggling students. I am currently constructing a white paper to analyze the external validity of this program and suggest its department-wide adoption.</p></div>

"><strong>ACEssability</strong><br><i>Founder</i><p>As a result of COVID, I joined a volunteer program for college students to tutor high schoolers, and I realized that much of the test prep work I was doing could be automated with an intelligent program. Currently, test preparation tutors and other options are often prohibitively expensive, and this likely exacerbates the existing income gap on such tests (for reference, in 2016 students whose family income was less than $80,000 scored an average of 4.1 points lower on the ACT than students whose family income was above $80,000--this gap grew from 2012 to 2016). ACEssability will provide a <strong>completely free</strong> personalized learning platform for studying for standardized tests. I've based the code on existing research about knowledge trees, so it uses your performance to maintain an internal tracker for how well the student has learned all important concepts. ACEssability uses this information to help students drill their weak areas, providing videos to help students fill holes in their knowledge.</p></div>

### Additional Data-Driven Research on Education

I really enjoy answering questions about educational policy with data and have had opportunities to pursue these questions at Harvard. Papers are available [upon request](mailto:alexanderchin@college.harvard.edu).

 - **Analyzing Heterogeneous Effects in Early Language Literature Interventions (ELLs) under Professor Kosuke Imai**: This paper uses LASSO Regression to identify covariates for heterogenous effect analysis without multiple testing bias. As one of the first applications of this technique to a smaller data set, it contributes methodologically by validating the usage of such a technique even with little data. It also concludes that ELLs close the reading gap between students (a heterogeneous effect that is critical to confirm since this is usually the underlying motivation for the program) and provides possible individualized treatment rules.
 - **Explaining Mechanisms for Charter School Growth in Differing Regulatory Environments under Professors Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz**: Using fixed effect analysis of charter school growth at the district level, I characterize two different mechanisms for charter school growth in Texas and Massachusetts (which have very different charter school regulatory environments).
